* General note: 
* Each gene allele has a specific notation (cs, D, etc.) universally used in biological science and breeding.
* Thus, the specific notation for each allele is neither my own, nor does it belong to the creators of the referenced generators.
* It's about equivalent to using "He" for helium.
