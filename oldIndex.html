<!-- styling
 think the background color can be set the same way I remember for perchance?
 maybe not. the curly brackets within the main style tags aren't recognized by VScode
 but I think I can apply it inline to the body tag?
 <body style="background-color:OldLace";>
 there we go. VScode recognizes it

 think css colors can be used here?
 OldLace for bg, SlateGray and DarkSlateGray for text? DarkSeaGreen too?-->

 <!-- styles: property with a value
 background-color is property, OldLace is value-->
