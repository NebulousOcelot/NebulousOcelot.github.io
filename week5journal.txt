week5journal.txt

week 5 of class, let's go.
feeling a bit out of it 'cause I got last week's work done early

starting with downloaded pdf of slides
why is it 06 and not 05? did you delete a week or something?

we do have a side goal for this week of making a functional dialog box
that's one of my favorite perchance things
let me copy-paste how this worked on perchance

<button id="show-settings" onclick="document.getElementById('settings').showModal()">[settingsText]</button>
<dialog id="settings">
  <button class="close-btn" onclick="document.getElementById('settings').close()">[settingsClose]</button>
    (various stuff)
</dialog>

and I assume this would all be in the <body>

...okay that handout needs to stay open throughout my work here
practical lecture is 2 hours in length
the split into html/css and Javascript seems really arbitrary to me?

the homework seems like it will need its own sub-folder
week5hw created

and let me copy-paste the instructions

-----
(step 1 download thingies)
Step 2: Make the following changes by updating the DOM.    

1pt student uses either the <script>....</script> within the document or links an external js doc 

When you click on the hamburger menu  this icon: image.png  it shows and hides the side nav bar. 
I have already taken care of the positioning for you. (2pts) 
HINT you will need to create a global boolean that controls this (isOpen = true)  
1 point: click on the hamburger menu and the side menu hides 
1 point: click on the hamburger menu and the side menu shows 

When the nav bar is hidden, the page changes width (3pts) -- see figma file below 
1 point:  When the side bar is shown - the content is in the original place 
2 point:  When the side bar is not shown - the content moves over and takes up more room. 

on MOBILE the side bar nav must take up the full screen, and users need to click the menu button to hide it again  
(see figma file below and check out apple.com in the responsive view for more info) 
(3pts)  
HINT: this is easier than you think!!! This is just all CSS :) 
1 point: the side bar is no longer on the top, it's hidden behind the hamburger menu 
1 point: the nav bar is shown and hidden by the hamburger menu 
 
Extra Credit for Animation  (it's possible for you to do this with classes and transitions) +3 

Step 3:  Upload this to your Github repo and name it anything other than index.html. 
this is important! If you upload it as index.html it'll replace your front page.  
SUBMIT THE LINK ON CANVAS. 
-----

on second thought. let's not use the folder?
downloaded files are now week5.html, week5favicon-32x32.png, and week5styles.css

we are going to use a week5.js. non-negotiable

on homework. what an annoying font mess this is.
let's try downloading those fonts. 

fonts that I see: DM Sans, DM Serif Display, Material Symbols Outlined
okay that last one is not cooperating
maybe, by downloading the woff2 that appears when I follow the direct link, it will...?
hmm. understanding looks like it's going to be difficult?

observations on stylesheet.
one, root selector used to set color names?
two, there's a nav style being applied *after* the main block

back to the fonts.
why have I dived into the homework when there's a practical to do.
whatever.

...okay this is the professor's index.html
the material-symbols-outlined is the hamburger menu
...

"Upload this to your Github repo and name it anything other than index.html. this is important! 
If you upload it as index.html it'll replace your front page."

...
... let's try substituting this with my week 3 index
okay. preparing a week5index

if I'm correct about this, I shouldn't be actually changing any of the styles?
I'm still gonna copy the existing styles so the page doesn't break, though

the professor is putting the icon on the tab how?

trying to search up how to do that.
okay. no luck

... really getting sick of this

live server testing
what the shit?
used dev tools and uhhh
my week5index.html is outputting the doctype within the body?
oh my fucking god. It was the exclamation point on the doctype
fucking hilarious

... and there's no discussion board for me to tell people about this
and I'm afraid to speak up or I'll get asked why I'm not in the discord...
well this is not good
guess I'm keeping it to myself

and back this evening
i noticed the positioning on week5index.html was misbehaving when the dev tool panel was open
nagging at me to correct it so here we are

I think I see it
nav is width 18 vw and 
hamburger is positioned at 13.5 vw
but its size is given in fixed pixels
can I make the hamburger size scale with vw?
will the icon itself scale with the font-size property?
yes. it does.

but 120% made it smaller?
so what is the default?
hmm. inspect what it is without the font-size attached
font-size is 24px.

now to test arithmetic
or maybe, this is where I start using js DOM stuff?

now to figure this out
okay. the document.getElementBy call needs to be saved to a variable.

... and that did not work.
new strategy: scale the positioning of the left nav and the bubble?

no. neither of those are working.
...
thinking I need to set default pixel numbers

assuming 1280 width
content's left = 244ish
leftnav's width = 230ish
hamburger's left, = 172ish
width, = 44
and height = 44

okay.
working, but I need to set the padding/margins in the nav too?

... Okay. The script isn't actually running.
What event can I set it to in order to make it run automatically?

Stack Overflow is providing this:
<body onload="codeAddress()">
(that has to be lowercase)

wth. still no evidence that this script is even running
yeah this is. just. wow.

...
maybe just adjust how the styling works,
and just do the assignment the way we should?

styling adjusted.
ugh.

okay.
good god. two tries and homework is not done
really, really frustrated with this
think I have no choice but to watch the damned lecture

okay maybe not? onclick seems to be working

I can make the scripts run, but can't change the elements?

good grief. it's late and I'm tired and clueless but dammit

it's catching on 
leftNav.style.width = "72px";

oh, okay
for whatever reason it doesn't like the semicolon

except now it's applying the style when I don't want it to be?

okay, second new discovery: 
HTML ELEMENTS CAN ONLY EXIST AS LOCAL VARIABLES.

...now it seems to be working?

Okay. That's objective one.

Objective two, make the content move too.
Okay. 

Last one is the media view.

First off, the hamburger needs to display in media view.
Hmm.
Let's make hamburger into a class instead.

Okay media view in general needs a fix.
default media view fixed.

okay, what the heck.
hideNav's if statement works
showNav's does not
no, wait. duh. left code outside the if else

why is NavUl staying permanently disappeared.
okay it works if started as hidden? but it can't start as none.
okay, need to use visibility property to hide it at first? maybe?
THERE WE GO.

extra credit is animating it.
I'm seeing something call interpolation on the MDN for the visbility property
... no, that's not helpful
Let's add active and hover to the menu?

also, is there an opacity property?
yes, there is
can I use a time variable?

or, perhaps a loop...

we're gonna try reducing opacity of a hidden menu to 20%

or maybe I'll just look up the transitions CSS property on MDN

oh what the heck has broken now? content isn't spaced

cut and pasting hamburgTransform()

// first attempt at dom changes. 
// this shouldn't be used anywhere in the final version,
// but I'm leaving it for personal reference
function hamburgTransform() {
    // assumed default width
    let defaultWidth = 1280;

    // elements
    let hamburger = document.getElementById("hamburger");
    let leftnav = document.getElementById("leftNav");
    let leftlist = document.getElementById("navUl");
    let content = document.getElementById('content');

    // numbers
    let hamburgSize = 24;
    let hamburgBubbleSize = 44;
    let hamburgLeft = 172;
    let leftNavWidth = 230;
    let leftListTop = 60;
    let contentLeft = 244;

    // I think this is the right constant to use?
    let actualWidth = innerWidth;
    let widthRatio = actualWidth/defaultWidth;

    // applying width ratio
    hamburgSize*=widthRatio;
    hamburgBubbleSize*=widthRatio;
    hamburgLeft*=widthRatio;
    leftNavWidth*=widthRatio;
    leftListTop*=widthRatio;
    contentLeft*=widthRatio;

    // applying to elements
    hamburger.fontSize = hamburgSize;
    hamburger.width = hamburgBubbleSize;
    hamburger.height = hamburgBubbleSize;
    hamburger.left = hamburgLeft;
    leftnav.width = leftNavWidth;
    leftlist.marginTop = leftListMarginTop;
    content.left = contentLeft;

    console.log("Hamburger executed.");
}

somehow removing that fixed things

last media view test before I draw up a Figma with the flowchart
okay. we're good. hopefully

... okay?
... hopefully this figma is acceptable
it is 10:30 PM
