Overview of Final Assignment

The Final Project is a web application of your choosing. It is worth 25 points. The web application has to be:

1. Have AT MOST 4 pages 
2. Javascript and CSS 
 (I don't care if it's linked or in the document)
3. Have multiple sections/divs with content
4. User Interactions: buttons, events that impact the DOM, conditionals based on dom etc...
5. Something that will change the webpage based in Javascript

Rubric
0-5 pts: Student has showcased competency with HTML 
(correct doc structure, unbroken links, proper styling) 
0-5 pts: Student has showcased competency with CSS 
(parent/child selectors, class and id styles, etc...)
0-5 pts: Student has made website responsive for Mobile devices 
0-5 pts: Student has showcased competency with Javascript 
(updating the DOM, creating interactivity, calling and storing information)
0-5 pts: Student has made a good effort with their delivery: 
(more than 1 sentence for sections, button stylings, css animations, javascript animations, you should show this to an employer)

Examples of how this can be spread:  

3 pts for responsiveness
2 pts for no broken HTML 

5 points EXTRA CREDIT: student calls a REST API OR a CDN 

A NOTE: For the final, I will be EXTREMELY meticulous on grading. Make sure all of your files are linked correctly, you don't have any broken images or files that do not exist.

FAQ:  

1. Can it be my portfolio that I have been working on all semester? 
Absolutely. Work smarter not harder.
I suggest an accordi.on, or an image gallery. (both are links) 
Or, you can use this app  to put into your portfolio.  

2. What does student has made a good effort with their delivery?  
Content! I want to see things implemented. 
Imagine your final is being showcased to a potential employer or for a scholarship. 
I don't want to see Lorem Ipsum, I don't want to see just one line or the bare minimum.  
See some examples that I did in JS Fiddle of Effort 

3. Can I use a CDN CSS?  

No. You will be deducted points for not writing your own CSS.  
If you can make an argument for using a CDN 
(like if you're using Leaflet and you need their CSS for the popups),  
it needs to be a good one.  
I need to see that you have implemented custom CSS for YOUR code, not theirs.  

4. Help, GitHub is being a pain!  
I am not grading you on your ability to use Github. 
Zip up all of your files + assets and upload that to Canvas. 
-----

first thought.
'meticulous on grading'
how did the students giving broken links even make it this far?

CDN css. Hmm. 
I imagine it would be allowed to modify their provided CSS,
as long as it's backed up by substantial custom CSS for other parts of the project?

The portfolio we've been working on all semester.
Unfortunately, that kind of clashes with the AT MOST 4 pages rule?
Does a dialog box count as a page?

either way, still going to backlink the final to my main GitHub for this class

I am kind of tempted to try making a Warrior Cats generator?
I do have a bunch of resources for that on my computer already
maybe some experimentation? 
See if I can get warriors-cat-clans or my version working?
that may be too complex though
how would I recreate the consumableList?

however, adding a new DIV for each cat, and keeping the random cat count
would possibly count as using JS to modify the DOM?

I'm picturing like a list of cat divs
and I'd hide some depending on the number?

...hmm
learning how to make a generator work without Perchance might be a good idea anyway?
since I still want to recreate Untold Legacy someday?

What is the Final Project pitch?
need to look at that one

copying Final Project pitch
-----
Since the Final Project covers a lot of topics. 
It'll be a good idea to think through what it is you want to submit.  
Grading for the Final is much more strict than the homework assignments.   
Double check your work, double check to see if you have hit all my requirements.  
This homework assignment is worth 10 points because it covers the Figma part of my requirements. 

Submit A Figma Document Containing The Following Info: 

What type of app are you trying to build?
Is there any research that you've done into types of UIs?   
Wireframe/design doc of what you're thinking the UI would look like. 
Simply stating "a minimalist design" is not enough, provide me a wireframe. 

Hint use https://coolors.co/ for colors

Do you need any help for any specific component? 
-----

Okay.
The warrior-cat-clans recreation idea is ambitious,
but it does provide me with a UI to point to? A clear target?

Perhaps another option is to recreate the kitten generator?

well if we do a warrior-cat-clans recreation, 
the trickiest stuff should be:
- recreation of random-selecting lists
- recreation of the consumable list
- creating a table to exclude specific problematic names

or...
maybe the kitten generator is a better idea?
could fill it with all kinds of infocards about cat genetics
and I do have both the kitten gen and my own warriors-family-advanced as UI examples

...
okay.
let's do a kitten generator

I need to nab code downloads off of Perchance
copies of kitten-generator and warriors-family-advanced nabbed

first thing to research is how to randomize things
how to recreate the Perchance list utility

okay, that's probably enough work for now

11/20/25
the best way to do infocards. 
probably dialog + one of those icons from Google, like the hamburger? just an i in a circle?

wireframe plus all kinds of thingies to figure out.

should I also make a color pallette for the cats?
I would just link out to the Cedarseed color chart, but the display on that is broken for me

11/21/25

need to put together the Figma
first, I gotta collect screenshots
and find an icon

hang on. found a URL to a sparrows-garden.com in the kitten-generator
let's poke around

https://sparrows-garden.com/genetics.html
https://sparrows-garden.com/genetics/cat-color-glossary.html

... this does confirm that the cinnamon tabby kitten I saw once was indeed a cinnamon tabby

okay. now get an icon?

comment that sparrows-garden seems to be using tooltips

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Outlined:opsz,wght,FILL,GRAD@20..48,100..700,0..1,-50..200&icon_names=info" />

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Outlined:opsz,wght,FILL,GRAD@24,400,0,0&icon_names=info" />
// using this one

<style>
.material-symbols-outlined {
  font-variation-settings:
  'FILL' 0,
  'wght' 400,
  'GRAD' 0,
  'opsz' 24
}
</style>

<span class="material-symbols-outlined">
info
</span>

that is for the i in a circle

figma. umm

put it together, then make a wireframe and just drop it in there?

11/24/2025

thoughts.
I will need to use JS to change the text within <p> tags.
I'm not sure how to do this.
If the text is saved as a property, then maybe...?
Should probs investigate by looking at a <p> tag in dev tools.

AME 220 main move accomplished.

What I am seeing is that text in the document is listed as a node. 
#text, which is child element to the wrapping tags
and the node has the data property set to the text string?

Can I mess with the css on index.html to affect the nodes?

No. That did not work.
Okay, let's look up how to change text on a page using JS.

From stack overflow:
document.getElementById("myspan").textContent="newtext";
hmm

okay I think that makes sense
The text just needs to be in a container of some kind.

documents set up
mess with this more later

We are being told to cite stack overflow in the weekly announcement.
That is very annoying, but whatever.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1358810/how-do-i-change-the-text-of-an-element-using-javascript

There, that's the stack overflow link I used.

And of course, warriors-family-advanced and the kitten-generator need citations.

I don't like that the professor responded to my presentation by asking how I would call Perchance's API.
I was never intending to say I would call Perchance's API, it's just going to be heavily referenced.
Doesn't say good things about her capability to understand.

11/25/2025

voiced complaints about the citation thing in course evaluations.
I think the new requirement is a result of professor egotism
and my response to that shit will always be to rebel
yes, I'm going to use resources that aren't yours
I'm not a sheep, get used to it

but I'm here because the whole "randomize values in normal JS" thing is bugging me
so I'm gonna collect MDN refs
maybe examine the p5.js random function

MDN search calls up a standard built-in JS Object "math," of which random() is a method
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random

details say that the random number is 0 <= random < 1.
similar to p5.js math

copying from that page's demo:
function getRandomInt(max) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * max);
}

This tells me that there is a floor method too.
Max... hmm.
Can that be an arbitrary numerical variable?
I can see that working.

Demo for getting a random number between two values:
function getRandomArbitrary(min, max) {
  return Math.random() * (max - min) + min;
}

I can kind of see the arithmetic on how that works.

Hmm, there's examples on random integers specifically,
but given the intended use here, do I really need that?
it's all coinflips between two values
can I set a condition test of Math.random() >= 0.5?
thinking I can, honestly

while here
I'm scrolling down to browser compatibility, and uh
node.js is listed as a browser?
hmm

is that the last external resource I need to collect for this?
think it might be
so now we gotta move into actually coding the thing

11/26/2025

now wondering if I have to cite the list of CSS colors
https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.php

it's that.

11/28/2025

starting to beat myself up over not having this done
i fucking loathe the citations requirement
really discouraging

finalCitations.txt exists now

11/29/2025
finally heard back
citations requirement is because the professor worries about uh
students copying her examples really closely
I didn't know this, I'm thinking I reacted too harshly

hmm maybe now start working on this
thinking I need to get the <table> <select> and <dialog> in here

okay, first test
<dialog> works. showModal()

now, to make the opening for that the i circle

... okay I'm thinking I want to put an icon on the tab
just so I can distinguish the live server easily
think we can reference week 5 for this one

and done

now back to the infocard button

okay, we're clear on that

okay copying this here
https://github.com/NebulousOcelot/NebulousOcelot.github.io/blob/main/fileName.txt

that's how I can link to the repository of anything
what do we need. code, js, styles, citations, journal, mainIndex.
counting six buttons from that.

6:14PM

what the shit?
.navButton {
    background-color:black;
    color:yellowgreen;
    margin:4px;
    padding:6px;
    padding-left:8px;
    padding-right:8px;
    font-size:0.667em;
    font-weight:bold;
    border-radius:6px;
}
is producing a beveled edge on the button?
i don't know how the hell I did this,
but I like the effect

I am fiddling with colors
need to get the table in here

button beveling is reproducible
border-radius with no other border instructions causes it

okay I swore I saw it working on the dialog close buttons
is there a noinherit property?

bwuh? it looks like it's not applied, then I interact with it and the edge bevels
execution order issue, perhaps?
There we go. The border-radius call has to happen after the dialog box styles.
or... no, still not working
solution:border-none on the dialog box
or maybe not
what the hell

theory, from the floralwhite rim around the button
the dialog box needs to be moved outside the body

nope
I don't have a way to stop this effect
so the best I can do is mitigate its visual appearance
dialog box has to be floral white

okay, we're fine

okay
we're going to do the numerical input by combining strings within one "p" field
this is so the user can input 100000 kittens if they wish

oh, this table is just gonna be insanity apparently

...
okay
we're making a global array variable to hold the parents' genes

I'm gonna go look at an AME 230 project real quick
table-format array

so it works as let variable = [[],[],];
and you call it as variable[rowNum][columnNum];

okay that was a lot of work for one evening
waiting until another night to finish
next part is getting the options sorted out
the <select> element

<select oninput="variable=this.value">
  <option value="blah"></option>
  <option value="blah"></option>
</select>

that's the syntax
for each gene except orange (sex-linked) I can copy-paste between mom and dad

okay really need to put this away for tonight
last comment: work berkshire swash into this somewhere

12/1/2025
nice free morning with nothing better to be done
and I look at a heavily white-spotted cat's picture and think of a certain distinction
we are now in select menu tedium

dialog titles and matching has happened

okay now I need to test the select menu
see if it's actually resetting the variables

okay yeah it is
dev tool view also means I need to mess with the styles

okay. let's get the select forest underway

colorpoint: five different alleles, lovely
C, cs (siamese), cb (burmese), c2 (blue-eyed albino), c (pink albino)

that's done. whew

Tedium is done!

It has now occurred to me that maybe I need a function to reset the parents' gene values?
And this requires resetting the select fields?
Is this too complicated, or...?
Yeah, I think it is. I can work around it by refreshing the page.

Okay have to go.
Next up: generator functionality, media responsiveness.
okay. good morning.

...why am I here in the evening when I've been grumbling about being caught up in tasks

uhh. I guess some thoughts on coding it together.
first off, I'm thinking an array containing the kittens' alleles needs to be made
a function needs to be made containing the text output for one kitten
so another function can loop through that as many times as necessary
and one last function can concat it all together

I'm gonna need a string and array function reference in the citations list.

... okay thinking I need a simpler way of handling the parents' genes
...
Can I do an array within an array within an array?

no, wait.
I can't exactly tell the options to carry more than one value.
Dammit, really do have to do this tedium.

okay, allele passing is implemented
now for the reader
push strings into an array, then join it

okay why the is <br><br> joining trick not working.

okay. need to look up a resource about line breaks.
possible resolution, copying from MDN:
console.log("string text line 1\nstring text line 2");
// "string text line 1
// string text line 2"

so it's a "\nstring"

no, maybe not
okay

so it's looking like a different line terminator needs to be used somehow

Joining the kitten array with "\n" is creating a nice effect.
Not intentional, but I'll take it.

uurf
this is tough

<p>
  O’er all the hilltops<br />
  Is quiet now,<br />
  In all the treetops<br />
  Hearest thou<br />
  Hardly a breath;<br />
  The birds are asleep in the trees:<br />
  Wait, soon like these<br />
  Thou too shalt rest.
</p>

...?
wrong syntax all along? Maybe?
Dammit, no.

Okay, what the shit.
Is there no way to do this?
Then, is there a way to create new HTML elements?

document.createElement(br)? 

...this is going to get really damn tricky.

we're copying a large block of code here, from when I thought the <br> separator could work

-----
function randomize() {
    // cleaning array for reuse
    kittenArray = [];

    let output = document.getElementById("kittenOut");
    let noOutput = document.getElementById("noOutput");

    for (i0 = 0; i0 < numKittens; i0 += 1) {
        kittenString = createKitten();
        kittenArray.push(kittenString);

        // cleaning array for reuse
        DescArray = [];
    }

    // console.log confirms kittenArray to be working here
    console.log(kittenArray);

    kittensString = `${kittenArray.join("<br />")}`;
    output.textContent = kittensString;

    // changing visibility
    output.style.visibility = "visible";
    noOutput.style.display = "none";
}

function createKitten() {
    kittenInherit();
    kittenReader(kitten);
}
-----

so the new plan is to repurpose createKitten to create new <p> elements
two new ones. we can class them as "kittenGeneText" and "kittenPhenoText."

okay, procedure:
- create new p
- give it text content
- insert into DOM 

okay, we're making an effort here to fix this.

New error: invalid custom element name.

It also occurs to me that the document will have to be cleaned of existing kittens.
And this means referring to each one somehow.
...Uh...
Push each kitten into an array?

is it getting hissy at me because there's a capital letter in the custom element name?

okay it was
but now we have this:

finalKittenGenScript.js:77 Uncaught NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'insertBefore' on 'Node': The node before which the new node is to be inserted is not a child of this node.
    at createKitten (finalKittenGenScript.js:77:19)
    at randomize (finalKittenGenScript.js:53:9)
    at HTMLButtonElement.onclick (finalKittenGen.html:271:64)
createKitten @ finalKittenGenScript.js:77
randomize @ finalKittenGenScript.js:53
onclick @ finalKittenGen.html:271

okay, maybe un-expedite the text content setting?

That didn't fix it.

... oh, now I'm going to insertBefore and I see it. 
I'm trying to insert it into the body.
That's not the parent node.

possibly fixed, let's check

removeChild now throwing the same error but progress.

is this thing now complaining because there's no style tags on noOutput to remove?
really?

... hrrm
if removing the message is a problem, how about it stays?

Well that's the first time I've seen things just outright freeze.

now it's bugging severely. wow.
oh wait, no. DescArray isn't being cleaned so it's doing this.

Okay, now it is working as intended.
Let's... apply some css to the new text, and uh
call it a night

tomorrow, finish desc stringy and media responsiveness

okay now the class identifier isn't showing up on the p tags
possible solution: adjust the style on each gene text before it gets added in

got it.
now things are looking much better.

so onto tomorrow I suppose
good god that was a lot of work

12/2/2025

okay the decision has been made that I will need a hamburger menu for the nav
or... hmm. Maybe there's some other option for decreasing the nav size on mobile?

either way, though
need to finish the gene reader script

dilute but non-caramel kittens are being read as caramel
as in, isCaramel is being flagged when it shouldn't be
what is this
I'm gonna ask it to print kitten too, so if it's an allele setting issue
Okay yeah it is. I'm seeing DmDm when neither of those should be Dm
Caught it. Parents' default alleles were still "DmDm".

There we go.
Now to put together the actual description.

And that might be done.
Now to move onto media responsiveness.
What properties need to be changed?

okay it appears that I promised a hamburger menu for mobile in my wireframe
uuggh. Okay. what did I do during week 5?

Hamburger not working properly whatsoever.
Hmm, what can be done? Decrease the buttons' size?

Making it position:relative and smaller seems like the best course of action.
Am I done with this?

...
Yeah. It might just be time to upload to Github.

nine files plus the index, going to Github. okay.
let's do it

footnote
12/2/2025, 7:30 PM after submitting and getting scolded.

So the Professor got really mad at me for the criticisms I had of her here. Called me unempathetic, went on about not considering her point of view. Said all of that, then pointedly reminded me that empathy is critical to the UX design field. 

I spiraled for a good four hours because of that shit, Professor. You're out of line. You know damn well that I have severe anxiety issues, from both my accommodations letter and my behavior in discussions, and have started over in college multiple times, yet you still went and said I was too heartless to succeed on this path. Where's your empathy for me? Did it even occur to you, that you might hurt my self-confidence?

I'm just gonna say it right now. Since the very first day of class, I saw a personality resemblance between you and that awful professor who verbally abused me in my first quarter of art school (why did you think I left the class Discord?). I considered dropping your class. I didn't. And now I regret it. You proved me right. 

I have no idea if you're ever going to see these words. But this is how the record stands.
