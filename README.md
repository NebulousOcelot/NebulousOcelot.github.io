Github Username: NebulousOcelot

(Currently a) Repository for ASU class AME 220, student username mecox8.

Notes for Professor, 10/13/2025: 
1) I'm using a username that I've used elsewhere on the internet because as stated in my introduction post, I want to make my own website eventually.
2) I have tried to apply for the Github student education plan twice. Both times it was immediately denied. The application reader apparently can't interpret the "Fall 2025" text on my unofficial transcript, and it doesn't like that I am located in a different state from ASU. There is seemingly no way to have it manually reviewed. I'm also worried about the ethics of using a student plan on an account being used partially for personal work. Therefore, I do not have the student developer pack for this class. If this is a problem, please contact me.
