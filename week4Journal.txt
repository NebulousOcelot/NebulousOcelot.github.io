okay I need someplace to start writing notes so here we go
week 4's lecture and follow-along

we're cutting right to the practical
I'm seeing the week's content defined as "conditionals, loops, functions"
and I'm just. is this not too easy?

I just want to know how to start using Javascript without the Perchance or p5js frames

slides, let's go

how to integrate JS into html
can exist within either the <head> or the end of the <body> within <script>
or, use script tag to define src="blah.js"
seems like same method as defining an image

the slides are taller than my screen, 
the page turner arrows are at the bottom,
and it sends me to the top of the slides when I turn the page
stupid UX issue

console.log(), know what that is already
...okay yeah this is seeming like a reiteration of AME 230

objects is really the only new one
we have reference pages. okay.
seems like p5js classes and some Perchance utilities are exploiting the object framework?

code to create a new object:
const name = {type:"meow", beep:"mew"}
const prevents reassigning it to a different variable
const doesn't make the object itself unchangeable

which... 
okay I can think of at least one existing Perchance gen where reassigning was necessary
that cat family gen, with the phenotype reader
the object it acted upon had to be set equal to each cat's object to work

{type:"meow", beep:"mew"}
is called an object literal

you are allowed to make empty objects
you are allowed to use object.property = value

the object literal can be fed into 
thingy = new Object()

properties can also be accessed with object.["property"]
presumably I can feed variables into there

you can give an object a method with
{meow: function() {
    return instructions; 
    }
}

instructions can be anything

also note on string handling
writing text + " " + text returns "text text"

this.property is usable

object constructor function
basically, define new function, set input variables, 
tell it to assign each to this.property

function Cat(meow, mew, beep) {
    this.meow = meow;
    this.mew = mew;
    this.beep = beep;
}

and then use thingy = new Cat(meow, mew, beep)

** is exponents
% is modulo division, returns only remainder

and now finally I see the difference between == and ===
latter matches data type too

have to do that practical now
hmm. bored. cat in lap
let's just watch and listen

/* creates commented out quote block*/

okay, I'm getting seriously bored/tired out already
maybe this week I shall examine the example code?

you are allowed to make arrays containing objects

well that's surprisingly little code in the example code

okay. looking at homework instructions, let me copy-paste
-----
Step 1:  Download this file
Step 2:  Follow my instructions in comments 
Step 3:  Upload the document to Canvas 

HINT PLEASE READ BECAUSE IT CAN BE CONFUSING AND NEBULOUS: 
When I ask for calling an array in the [3] position, 
I am looking for the THIRD value - AKA THE 3RD VALUE THE ARRAY 
(how we would reference the 3rd value is how we would say it in spoken language, 
but how would we implement this in program)  

Rubric:  

1 point for submission 
0-9 points on how accurate/correct the handout is
-----

homework.js
let's see

okay. quiz submitted.
let's fuss over this another time?

back.
let's try and get this started?

let's make a week4 embed html and a week4 script js
